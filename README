 Ample SDK - JavaScript GUI Framework
 http://www.amplesdk.com
 ------------------------------------

 About:
 ===============
   Ample SDK is a standard-based cross-browser JavaScript GUI Framework
   for building client-side Rich Internet Applications. It employs XML
   technologies (such as XUL, SVG or HTML5) for UI layout, CSS for UI style
   and JavaScript with DOM3 or jQuery-like APIs for application logic.
   It equalizes browsers and brings technologies support to those missing any.

 Running Options:
 ===============
   There are 2 options to run Ample SDK source - either to build project with Ant and use
   the build version or setup your development environment so that it compiles on the fly.

   You may find first option interesting if you are planning to use Ample SDK
   and the second option in case you are planning to develop Ample SDK itself.

   1. Building with Ant (PHP required)
      The build script is located in "build/build.xml". Before running the script
      adjust path to your PHP executable and build destination in "build/build.local.properties"

   2. Running with Apache (mod_rewrite, .htaccess support and PHP required)
      There is a simple mechanism implemented that involves Apache's mod_rewrite to redirect
      requests for files to respectful PHP scripts that concatenate source folders contents
      into single files on the fly.
      If you are using different web-server or/and different server-side language,
      you may want to look into the "ample/.htaccess" file and "ample/runtime.php" PHP script
      and implement similar gluing mechanisms for the platform of your choice.
